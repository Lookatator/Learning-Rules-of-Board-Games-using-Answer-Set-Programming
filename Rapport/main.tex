\section{Answer Set Programming (ASP)}

\subsection{Logic Program}

We will work on finite Logic Programs with rules of the form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, \text{ not } c_1, \text{ not } c_2,...,\text{ not } c_n$ (also called \textit{constraint}).
\item $a \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, \text{ not } c_1, \text{ not } c_2,...,\text{ not } c_n$. This is a \textit{default} rule.
\item $l\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}u \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, \text{ not } c_1, \text{ not } c_2,...,\text{ not } c_n$, where $l$ and $u$ are numbers such that $l \leq u$. Also, $l\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}u$ is true in an Herbrand Interpretation $I$ iff $ l \leq |\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}\cap I | \leq u$. This type of rule is also called \textit{choice rule}.
\end{itemize}
In all these rules, "$\text{ not }$" refers to the \textit{"negation as failure"}, and $a, a_1, a_2, ..., a_p, b_1, b_2,\\ ..., b_m, c_1, c_2, ...,  c_n$ are atoms. 

\smallskip

$a$ and $l\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}u$ are called the \textit{head} of the rule, and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, \text{ not } c_1, \text{ not } c_2,\\..., \text{ not } c_n$ is the \textit{body} of the rule. If we call $r$ the following rule: $\alpha \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m,\\ \text{ not } c_1, \text{ not } c_2,...,\text{ not } c_n$ where $\alpha$ is either an atom or an aggregate, then $body^+(r)=\{b_1, b_2,...,b_m \}$ and $body^-(r)=\{c_1, c_2,...,c_n \}$.

\smallskip

A \textit{literal} is an atom or the negation (by failure) of an atom.

\subsection{Stable Models (Answer Sets)}

Let $P$ be a logic program and $X$ be an Herbrand Interpretation of $P$. From $P$ and $X$, we can construct a new program $P^X$ called the \textit{reduct} of $P$ by applying these methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item For every rule $r\in P$, if $X\cap body^-(r)=\emptyset$, then we remove every negative literal in $r$.
\item Otherwise, if $X\cap body^-(r)\neq\emptyset$, then we delete the whole rule.
\item We replace every constraint $ :- body$ by $\perp :- body$. Here $\perp$ is an atom that does not appear in $P$. As a consequence, $\perp$ does not belong to any Answer Set.
\item For every rule $r$ with an aggregate in the head: $l\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}u \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$ (we suppose that we have already removed the negative literals according to the first method)
\begin{itemize}
\item if $l \leq |\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_p\}\cap X | \leq u$, we replace $r$ by all the rules in the following set: $\{ a_i \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m | a_i \in X\}$.
\item otherwise, we replace $r$ by $\perp \leftarrow b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Thus, the reduct $P^X$ is a \textit{definite} logic program (which means that it does not contain any negation as failure). Definite logic programs have a unique minimal Herbrand model, that is very easy to construct. We will write $M(P^X)$ the minimal Herbrand model of $P_X$.

\smallskip

We call \textit{stable model} of $P$ every Herbrand interpretation $X$ that satisfies the relation: $X=M(P^X)$. Moreover, as we do not use classical negation $\neg$, we will not make a distinction between \textit{answer sets} and stable models.

\smallskip

Stable models of $P$ have more properties than its models in general: they also are \textit{minimal} (for inclusion) and \textit{supported} (every atom in the stable model appears in a rule whose body evaluates to \textit{true}). 

\subsection{Tools}

For ASP problems, we will use some of the tools developed by the University of Potsdam: \texttt{gringo}, \texttt{clasp} and \texttt{clingo}. \texttt{gringo} transforms the logic program in input into an equivalent variable-free program (it is a \textit{grounder}). And \texttt{clasp} is a \textit{solver} capable of solving ground logic programs. Finally, \texttt{clingo} only combines grounding (with \texttt{gringo}) and solving (with \texttt{clasp}).

\section{Single-Player Games in ASP}

It is possible to formalize and solve Single-Player Games in ASP. To illustrate the predicates that can be used to describe these games, we will focus on a basic example: a simple graph game.

%TODO : référence 

\subsection{Rules of the game}

The rules of the graph game on figure \ref{fig:agent} are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The player starts in state $a$.
\item If the player is in state $a$ or in state $b$ then he can go to the left or to the right.
\item The player wins iff he goes to the state \textit{"victory"}.
\item The player cannot go back to state $a$ once he has reached the state \textit{"hole"}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\hsize]{diagram1.png}
\caption{Simple graph game}
\label{fig:agent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Formalizing these rules}

\begin{itemize}



\item We start by defining the different players in the game by using the predicate \texttt{role}. Here, there is only one player so we include the fact: \texttt{role(player).}

\smallskip

\item Then, we define what are the initial states by using the predicate \texttt{holds} for the first time-step:\newline
\texttt{holds(hole, empty, 1).}\\
\texttt{holds(a, player, 1).} \% the player is in state $a$\\
\texttt{holds(b, empty, 1).}\\
\texttt{holds(victory, empty, 1).}

\item We also say what actions are legal at time $T$, depending on the state the player is:\newline
\texttt{legal(player,go(left),T) :- holds(a,player,T) ; holds(b,player, T)}\\
\texttt{legal(player,go(right),T) :- holds(a,player,T) ; holds(b,player,T)}

\item And we explain the situation at time $T+1$ depends on what holds at time $T$ and what the player does:\newline
\texttt{holds(hole,player,T+1) :- holds(a,player,T), does(player,go(left),T).}\\
\texttt{holds(b,player,T+1) :- holds(a,player,T), does(player,go(right),T).}\\
\texttt{...}

\item We can also define what is a \texttt{terminal} state, and we can evaluate each final state by using the predicate \texttt{goal}: \newline
\texttt{terminal(T) :- holds(victory, player, T).}\\
\texttt{terminal(T) :- holds(hole, player, T).}\\
\texttt{goal(player,100,T) :- holds(victory, player, T).}\\
\texttt{goal(player,  0,T) :- holds(hole, player, T).}
\end{itemize}

We will follow the following Game Description Language (GDL) restriction: the predicate \texttt{does} does not appear in the definition of \texttt{terminal}, \texttt{goal} or \texttt{legal}. Also, \texttt{does} only appears in rule bodies. 

\subsection{Finding a solution to the game}

We have just defined a few predicates to translate the rules of the game in ASP. Now we want to simulate the game and to find winning sequences of moves.
\begin{itemize}
\item First of all, the player can do only one move at every time step (as long as the game is not finished).\newline
\texttt{1\{does(player,go(left),T);does(player,go(right),T)\}1 :- not terminated(T).}\\
Where \texttt{terminated(T)} is true if and only if there is a T1 such that $T1<T$ and \texttt{terminal(T1)} is true:\newline
\texttt{terminated(T) :- terminal(T).}  \\
\texttt{terminated(T+1) :- terminated(T).}

\item Also, every move that is played must be legal:\newline
\texttt{:- does(player, M, T), not legal(player, M, T).}

\item We want the game to terminate at some point:\newline
\texttt{:- 0\{terminated(T) : time\_domain(T)\}0.}\\
\texttt{time\_domain(1..10). \% We allow at most 10 moves} 

\item 

\end{itemize}



\section{Inductive Logic Programming}

In this part, $B$ is the logic program that represents the \textit{Background Knowledge}, $S_M$ is the set of possible hypotheses, $E^+$ is the set of positive examples (all the elements that have been observed) and $E^-$ is the set of negative examples (all the elements that can't appear in any result). Our task is to find an hypothesis $H\in S_M$ such that $B\cup H$ \textit{explains} $E^+$ and $E^-$. There are different ways of defining the word "explains" used in the last sentence. We will have a look at three of them.

%TODO S_M ???

\subsection{Brave Inductive Logic Programming}

\subsubsection{Brave Induction}

A brave inductive task is a tuple $T_b=<B, E^+, E^->$ (where $E^+$ and $E^-$ are sets of atoms occurring in $B$) such that: an hypothesis $H$ is solution of $T_b$ iff there is an answer set $A$ of $B\cup H$ verifying $E^+\subseteq A$ and $E^-\cap A = \emptyset$

\smallskip

We call $ILP_b(B,E^+,E^-)$ the set of hypotheses that are solutions of $T_b$. 

\subsubsection{ASPAL encoding}

%TODO défauts d'ASPAL

\subsection{Cautious Inductive Logic Programming}

A cautious inductive task is a tuple $T_c=<B, E^+, E^->$ (where $E^+$ and $E^-$ are sets of atoms occurring in $B$) such that: an hypothesis $H$ is solution of $T_c$ iff 
\begin{itemize}
\item $B\cup H$ has at least one answer set
\item every answer set of $B\cup H$ verifies $E^+\subseteq A$ and $E^-\cap A = \emptyset$
\end{itemize}

We call $ILP_c(B,E^+,E^-)$ the set of hypotheses that are solutions of $T_c$. 

%TODO pas possible avec clingo

\subsection{Inductive Learning From Answer Sets Programming}

We present here a new type of inductive task which is more general than the cautious and the brave inductive tasks.

\subsubsection{Partial Interpretations}

We call \textit{partial interpretation} a tuple $<e^+,e^->$ where $e^+=\{e^+_1,e^+_2,...,e^+_m\}$ and $e^-=\{e^-_1,e^-_2,...,e^-_n\}$ are two sets of atoms.

\smallskip

We say that an interpretation $I$ of $B$ extends a partial interpretation $<e^+,e^->$ iff $e^+ \subseteq I$ and $e^- \cap I = \emptyset$.

\subsubsection{Learning from Answer Sets Induction}

A Learning from Answer Sets task is a tuple $T_{LAS}=<B, S_M, E^+, E^->$ (where $E^+$ and $E^-$ are sets of partial interpretations) such that: an hypothesis $H$ is solution of $T_{LAS}$ iff 
\begin{itemize}
\item For all  $<e^+,e^->\in E^+$, there is an answer set of $B\cup H$ that extends $<e^+,e^->$
\item For all  $<e^+,e^->\in E^-$, there are no answer sets of $B\cup H$ that extend $<e^+,e^->$
\end{itemize}

We call $ILP_{LAS}(B,S_M,E^+,E^-)$ the set of hypotheses that are solutions of $T_{LAS}$. 

\subsubsection{ILASP}

ILASP is a tool developed at Imperial College London that is capable of finding optimal hypotheses for Learning from Answer Sets tasks. We only need to give it: the background knowledge with the \texttt{clingo} syntax, and the mode declaration for the variables that can appear in the head or in the body of a rule in the hypothesis. We can also specify the positive and negative partial interpretations of the task.

\begin{itemize}
\item Learning from Answer Sets Induction
\item ILASP
\begin{itemize}
\item examples of what has been done so far
\item learning weak constraints ?
\item contexts
\item noisy examples
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Two-Players games}

\subsection{Representing Two-Players games in ASP}

We only need to change a few things to adapt the rules in single-player games for two-players games:
\begin{itemize}
\item First of all, we create two roles instead of one:\\ \texttt{role(player1).}\\
\texttt{role(player2).}
\item Then we replace \texttt{player} in every rule by the variable \texttt{P}, and we add \texttt{role(P)} at the end of each rule.
\item Besides, only one move is allowed at each time step:\\
\texttt{1\{does(P,M,T):role(P),move\_domain(M)\}1 :- not terminated(T).}\\
\texttt{move\_domain(go(left))}.\\
\texttt{move\_domain(go(right))}.

\item Finally, a player cannot play twice:\\
\texttt{:- does(P,M1,T), does(P,M2,T+1).}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Games under study}

This project focuses on three games: \textit{Five Field Kono}, \textit{Nine Men's Morris} and \textit{ASALTO}.

%TODO : give references

\smallskip

For the moment, we have only tried to study how to learn a strategy on a very simple game (with a small number of possible states): the \textit{tic-tac-toe}. Afterwards, we will try to extend what we have done on \textit{tic-tac-toe} to \textit{Five Field Kono}.

\smallskip

Moreover, we have represented these four games in ASP.

\section{Finding/Learning a strategy}

We found several ways of thinking about how to learn a strategy:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first one consists in trying to find a move such that: whatever the second player does the next turn (or his 2 or 3 next turns), the first player can still win. This method seems very similar to the \textit{minimax} algorithm. 
\item We could also study several games played by two players, and try to make hypotheses about what to do in which circumstances. 
\item It is possible to imagine a mix between the two previous methods: the second one tells us what are the good states, and the first method gives us a move so that we can reach a good state for sure (whatever the second player does).
\end{itemize}

For the moment, we have only studied the first method.

%TODO : give references (minimax)
%TODO : parler des inconvénients de chaque méthode.

\subsection{Planning moves}

\subsubsection{Basic method}

In \textit{tic-tac-toe}, we initialized the game with 4 specific moves already done. If we restrict the hypothesis space by not allowing negation by failure nor constraints, ILASP can find some (ground) hypotheses of the form:\\
\texttt{does(player1,fill(cell(x)),5). \% at time T=5 } \\
\texttt{does(player1,fill(cell(y)),7) :- does(player2,fill(cell(z)),6).}\\
that make \texttt{player1} win. 

\smallskip

For this, we only need to specify that the program has at least an answer set: \texttt{\#pos(\{\},\{\})}, and that \texttt{player1} wins in every answer set: \texttt{\#neg(\{\},\{wins(player1)\})}.

\subsubsection{Problem with negation by failure}
