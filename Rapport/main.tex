\chapter{Learning strategies}

% 

For the moment, we only have implemented the \textit{tic-tac-toe} and the \textit{Field Field Kono} in python by using \texttt{pygame} (python library for video games).
%TODO : reference pygame
\smallskip

The idea would be to learn from the actions performed by a player to train our system by using ILASP. Then we could make him play against this trained system and continue to train it that way.

\section{First Method: maximize the chances of winning}
%TODO : Change title ?

\subsection{Learning Exception Structure}

Supposing we are at time $T=t$, we want the computer to induce a set of rules $H$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a move $m$ such that for every answer set $A$ of $B\cup H,\:  does(player1, m, t)\in A$
\item For every answer set $A$ of $B\cup H$, for all move $m_1$ different from $m$, we have: $does(player1, m_1, t) \notin A$
\item $H$ also tries to take into account the possible future moves.
\end{itemize}

To reduce the hypothesis space, it would be interesting to focus only on \textit{exception structures}, which means we want $H$ to be of this form:
\[H=
\begin{Bmatrix}
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t0\_1, t).}\\
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t2\_1, t+2) :- \textcolor{red}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_1, t+1)}.}\\
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t2\_2, t+2) :- not \textcolor{red}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_1, t+1)}.} 
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
%TODO : A FAIRE avec le cours de Marek Sergot ???
In the set above, we will call "\textit{exception rule}" the second rule, and "\textit{general rule}" the third.

\begin{remark}
 The hypothesis space could also be extended so that it accepts two or more  exception rules.
\[H=
\begin{Bmatrix}
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t0\_1, t).}\\
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t2\_1, t+2) :-} &\texttt{\textcolor{red}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_1, t+1)}.}\\
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t2\_2, t+2) :-} &\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_2, t+1)}.}\\
\texttt{does(player1, move\_p1\_t2\_3, t+2) :-} &\texttt{not \textcolor{red}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_1, t+1)},}\\ &\texttt{not \textcolor{blue}{does(player2, move\_p2\_t1\_2, t+1)}.} 
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
\end{remark}

%TODO : Deuxième remarque pour expliquer comment prendre en compte ce qu'il se passe à t+4 ?

Moreover, the atoms in the exception rule must appear in the general rule (see the \textcolor{red}{red} and \textcolor{blue}{blue} atoms in the hypotheses above).

\bigskip

%TODO : good version of ILASP ?
With ILASP 3.1.0 it is possible add "bias constraints" to specify what kind of rule we want to learn. However it is not possible to add constraints on the whole set of rules induced. As a consequence, we cannot say that for every solution $H$ in $ILP_{LAS}(B,S_M,E^+,E^-)$, 
if there are $move\_p1\_t2\_1$ and $move\_p2\_t1\_1$ such that:
\\ $\texttt{"does(player1,move\_p1\_t2\_1,t+2) :- \textcolor{red}{does(player2,move\_p2\_t1\_1,t+1)}."}\in H$, 
then there is $move\_p1\_t2\_2$ such that:\\
$\texttt{"does(player1,move\_p1\_t2\_2,t+2):- not \textcolor{red}{does(player2,move\_p2\_t1\_1,t+1)}."}\in H$

\bigskip

The solution we used consists in using the ASPAL encoding in ILASP. With this encoding, we can add more flexible constraints for the hypothesis space.

\subsection{Example}

\paragraph{Current State of the Game}

Consider a tic-tac-toe game after the 4 following moves (represented in \ref{fig:ttt_ex}):\newline
\texttt{does(player1, fill(coord(2,2)),1).\\
does(player2, fill(coord(1,2)),2).\\
does(player1, fill(coord(1,1)),3).\\
does(player2, fill(coord(3,3)),4).}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.3\hsize]{figures/ttt_example.png}
\caption{State of a tic-tac-toe game after 4 moves. The green player plays first (he is \texttt{player1}).}
\label{fig:ttt_ex}
\end{figure}

Here, we are the green player and we want to find a move such that we are sure to win in three moves.

\paragraph{Hypothesis space}

We use the following mode declaration:
\[ M=
\begin{Bmatrix} 
m1 :& \texttt{modeh(does(player1,\#move,5)).} \\ 
m2 :& \texttt{modeh(does(player1,\#move,7)).}\\
m3 :& \texttt{modeb(does(player2,\#move,6)).}\\
m4 :& \texttt{modeb(not does(player2,\#move,6)).}
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
%TODO : explain how a mode declaration works OR reference to an article to explain it

Moreover, we take the following hypothesis space:
\[ R_M=
\begin{Bmatrix}
\texttt{does(player1, X, 5).} \\ 
\texttt{does(player1, Z, 7) :-} & \texttt{does(player2, Y, 6).}\\
\texttt{does(player1, X, 7) :-}  & \texttt{not does(player2, Y, 6).}
\end{Bmatrix}
\]

So the top theory that we use for this example is:
\[ T=
\begin{Bmatrix}
\texttt{does(player1, X, 5) :-} & \texttt{legal(player1,X,5), rule((m1),(X)).} \\ 

\texttt{does(player1, Z, 7) :-} & \texttt{legal(player1, Z, 7), legal(player2, Y, 6), }\\ 
 & \texttt{does(player2, Y, 6), rule((m2,m3,2),(Z,Y)).} \\

\texttt{does(player1, X, 7) :-} & \texttt{legal(player1, X, 7), legal(player2, Y, 6), } \\
& \texttt{not does(player2, Y, 6), rule((m2,m4,2),(X,Y)).}
\end{Bmatrix}
\]
where we added the predicate \texttt{legal/3} to make the variables safe.

\bigskip

So now the hypothesis we want to learn with ILASP has the following form:
\[H=
\begin{Bmatrix}
\texttt{rule((m1),(\#move\_p1\_t0\_1)).}\\
\texttt{rule((m2,m3,2),(\#move\_p1\_t2\_1, \#move\_p2\_t1\_1))}.\\
\texttt{rule((m2,m4,2),(\#move\_p1\_t2\_2, \#move\_p2\_t1\_1))}.
\end{Bmatrix}
\]

\bigskip

We want $H$ to contain only one rule of each type: only one rule of the form\\ \texttt{rule((m1),(\#move\_p1\_t0\_1))} and so on... 
So we add some rules to make them unique:\newline
\texttt{rule1 :- rule((m1),(fill(coord(X,Y)))).}\\
\texttt{:- not rule1.}\\
\texttt{:- rule((m1),(fill(coord(X1,Y1)))), rule((m1),(fill(coord(X2,Y2)))), g(X1, Y1)< g(X2, Y2). }\\

\smallskip

The two first rules make \texttt{rule((m1),(\#move\_p1\_t0\_1))} appear at least once, and the last rule makes it appear at most once. We add similar rules for \texttt{rule((m2,m3,2), (\#move\_p1\_t2\_1, \#move\_p2\_t1\_1))} and \texttt{rule((m2,m4,2), (\#move\_p1\_t2\_2, \#move\_p2\_t1\_1))}.

\bigskip

Also, we added some constraints to reduce the computation time. For instance, if \texttt{rule((m1),(fill(coord(X,Y))))} is true, then \texttt{legal(player1,fill(coord(X,Y)),5)} must be true. So we add the following constraint:\newline
\texttt{:- rule((m1),(fill(coord(X,Y)))), not legal(player1,fill(coord(X,Y)),5).}

\bigskip

And if \texttt{rule((m2,m4,2),(fill(coord(X,Y)),fill(coord(Z,T))))} and \texttt{not does(player2, fill(coord(Z,T)), 6)} are true, then \texttt{legal(player1, fill(coord(X,Y)),7)} must be true unless \texttt{player2} plays in \texttt{coord(X,Y)} at time 6. Thus, we add the following constraint:\newline
\texttt{:- rule((m2,m4,2),(fill(coord(X,Y)),fill(coord(Z,T)))), not does(player2, fill(coord(Z,T)), 6),}
\texttt{ not legal(player1, fill(coord(X,Y)),7).}\newline
and we add this context-dependent example to the set of positive examples : \newline
$<<\{\texttt{wins(player2,8)}\},\emptyset>,\\ \{\texttt{:- rule((m2,m4,2),(fill(coord(X,Y)),fill(coord(Z,T)))),} \\ \texttt{not does(player2, fill(coord(X,Y)), 6).}\}>$
%TODO : change fonts to textt in partial interpretations

\smallskip

With this example, we are sure that there will be at least one answer set where \texttt{player2} plays in \texttt{coord(X,Y)}.


\paragraph{Declaring the examples}

First of all, we want the first player to win in two moves all the time. So there is no answer set that does not contain \texttt{wins(player1,8)}. Thus, we take : $E^-=\{<\emptyset,\{\texttt{wins(player1,8)}\}>\}$.

\bigskip

For the positive examples, we only need to take the one given in the previous paragraph. The \texttt{wins(player2,8)} in it is optional but it reduces the computation time from 11 seconds to 1 second.

\paragraph{Evaluation}

%TODO : to complete

\subsection{Finding a move in the middle of a game}

We are only able to look two moves ahead, so we cannot predict how to win a game if we are not very close to the end. It would be a good idea to define what a good state is (or to make ILASP learn it). And after that, it could be possible to choose a state at time $t$ that maximizes the chances of reaching a good state at time $t+2$.

\bigskip

For instance, if we consider the game represented in figure \ref{fig:graph_game}, where \texttt{player1} plays at times $t$ and $t+2$ and \texttt{player2} plays at time $t+1$. 

\smallskip

We want to maximize the probability of reaching a good state at $t+2$. So we choose $a(x)$ such that $\#\{b(y)|legal(b(y))\wedge\:\left( b(y) \implies \exists \:c(z) \:;\: legal(c(z)) \wedge good\_state(state\_c(z)) \right)\}$ is maximal, which is $a(1)$ in this example.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\hsize]{figures/graph_game.png}
\caption{Desription of a graph game with its states and the actions to perform to go from one state to another. The blue player (that plays at times $t$ and $t+2$) is \texttt{player1}. The states in purple are the good states.}
\label{fig:graph_game}
\end{figure}

\section{Second Method: recognize preferred moves and states}

Goal: learn the preferences of the player by using Weak Constraints.

\subsection{Learning what kind of action the player prefers}

\emph{When we have the choice of the kind of action like in Five Field Kono : Learning  direction, up\_right, down\_right... }

%TODO : not very interesting isn't it ? cos' it could be done just by counting them.

\subsection{Discover the states of the board that the player chooses}

%TODO : Talk about the the drawbacks of last subsection: does not give enough information. So now we learn what kind of configuration the player prefers in a game. 

%TODO : parler des limitations de la section précédente.
% certes on pourrait lier les deux: does() :- holds(), holds(),...
% Mais serait trop computationally expensive ???

\subsubsection{General Idea}

We consider that the game is in a state $s_{i,t}$ at time $t$. After one player performs an action $a_{i,j,t}$, the game is in a new state $s_{j,t+1}$ (at time $t+1$).

%TODO : IMAGE
\smallskip

The idea would be to learn some weak constraints explaining why this action $a_{i,j,t}$ is the best according to the player. In particular, we could learn:
\begin{itemize}
\item why the action $a_{i,j,t}$ is better than all the others: $a_{i,x,t}$ for $x\neq j$. %TODO : Problem with learning actions 
\item why the new state $s_{j,t}$ is better than all the others: $s_{x,t}$ for $x\neq j$. To do so, we will look at the small patterns that appear on small sections of board (see Figure \ref{fig:FFK_pattern}). 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\hsize]{figures/FFK_pattern.png}
\hspace{0.1\hsize}
\includegraphics[width = 0.4\hsize]{figures/FFK_include_pattern.png}
\caption{Example of small pattern (on the left) that appears twice on the board (on the right) for Five Field Kono}
\label{fig:FFK_pattern}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{How to represent patterns in Five Field Kono}

We first define some predicates to represent the most basic patterns, that we will call \textit{elementary patterns}.

\smallskip

We focus on those that are the most relevant \textbf{to the blue player}. Thus, knowing that the pawns only move diagonally, and that the blue pawns tend to move to the right (considering the initial configuration in figure \ref{fig:FFK_initial}), we only consider the elementary patterns described in table \ref{elementary_patterns}.

%TODO : enlever le temps/remettre le temps je ne sais pas
%TODO : insister sur le fait qu'on se place du point de vue du joueur bleu

\begin{table}[h]
\centering

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\hsize]{figures/FFK_pattern1.png}} & 

\makecell[l]{
Two \textbf{adjacent} pawns:\\
\texttt{adjacent(bottom, blue, c1, c2)}\\
We have an analogue definition in case \texttt{c2} is to the right of \texttt{c1}.\\
We do not need to define \texttt{adjacent} if \texttt{c2} is to the right or to the \\
left of \texttt{c1} as  \texttt{adjacent(top, blue, c1, c2)} and \\
\texttt{adjacent(left, blue, c1, c2)} are respectively equivalent to \\
\texttt{adjacent(bottom, blue, c2, c1)} and \\
\texttt{adjacent(right, blue, c2, c1)}
}\\
\\
\hline
\\
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\hsize]{figures/FFK_pattern2.png}} & 
\makecell[l]{
Two rival pawns that are colliding:\\
\texttt{diagonal\_collision(down\_right, red, c1, c2)}\\
We have a similar definition, for the \texttt{up\_right} direction.
}\\
\\
\hline
\\
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.2\hsize]{figures/FFK_pattern4.png}} & 
\makecell[l]{
\texttt{diagonal\_collision(down\_right, empty, c1, c2)}\\
We have a similar definition, for the \texttt{up\_right} direction.

We have a similar definition, for the \texttt{up\_right} direction.
}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Elementary patterns that are considered}
\label{elementary_patterns}
\end{table}

\bigskip

Now we can build more complex configurations by combining these elementary patterns.

\begin{example}
In figure \ref{fig:FFK_pattern}, the configuration can be represented by the following formula:\\
\texttt{adjacent(bottom, blue, c1, c2)} $\bigwedge$ \texttt{diagonal\_collision(down\_right, empty, c1, c4)} $\bigwedge$ \texttt{diagonal\_collision(up\_right, red, c2, c3)}
\end{example}

\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}


\begin{comment}

\chapter{Progress}

\section{Two-Players games}

\subsection{Representing Two-Players games in ASP}

We only need to change a few things to adapt the rules in single-player games for two-players games:
\begin{itemize}
\item First of all, we create two roles instead of one:\\ \texttt{role(player1).}\\
\texttt{role(player2).}
\item Then we replace \texttt{player} in every rule by the variable \texttt{P}, and we add \texttt{role(P)} at the end of each rule.
\item Besides, only one move is allowed at each time step:\\
\texttt{1\{does(P,M,T):role(P),move\_domain(M)\}1 :- not terminated(T).}\\
\texttt{move\_domain(go(left))}.\\
\texttt{move\_domain(go(right))}.

\item Finally, a player cannot play twice:\\
\texttt{:- does(P,M1,T), does(P,M2,T+1).}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Games under study}

This project focuses on three games: \textit{Five Field Kono}, \textit{Nine Men's Morris} and \textit{ASALTO}.

%TODO : give references

\smallskip

For the moment, we have only tried to study how to learn a strategy on a very simple game (with a small number of possible states): the \textit{tic-tac-toe}. Afterwards, we will try to extend what we have done on \textit{tic-tac-toe} to \textit{Five Field Kono}.

\smallskip

Moreover, we have represented these four games in ASP.

\section{Finding/Learning a strategy}

We found several ways of thinking about how to learn a strategy:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first one consists in trying to find a move such that: whatever the second player does the next turn (or his 2 or 3 next turns), the first player can still win. This method seems very similar to the \textit{minimax} algorithm. 
\item We could also study several games played by two players, and try to make hypotheses about what to do in which circumstances. 
\item It is possible to imagine a mix between the two previous methods: the second one tells us what are the good states, and the first method gives us a move so that we can reach a good state for sure (whatever the second player does).
\end{itemize}

For the moment, we have only studied the first method.

%TODO : give references (minimax)
%TODO : parler des inconvénients de chaque méthode.

\subsection{Planning moves}

\subsubsection{Basic method}

In \textit{tic-tac-toe}, we initialized the game with 4 specific moves already done. If we restrict the hypothesis space by not allowing negation by failure nor constraints, ILASP can find some (ground) hypotheses of the form:\\
\texttt{does(player1,fill(cell(x)),5). \% at time T=5 } \\
\texttt{does(player1,fill(cell(y)),7) :- does(player2,fill(cell(z)),6).}\\
that make \texttt{player1} win. 

\smallskip

For this, we only need to specify that the program has at least an answer set: \texttt{\#pos(\{\},\{\})}, and that \texttt{player1} wins in every answer set: \texttt{\#neg(\{\},\{wins(player1)\})}.

\subsubsection{Problem with negation by failure}
